AN ORDINANCE INSTITUTIONALIZING KATUWANG SA DIWA AT GAWA SA MASAGANANG ANI AT MATAAS NA KITA (KADIWA) NG PANGULO (KNP) IN THE CITY OF MANILA



EXPLANATORY NOTE

This Ordinance aims to institutionalize the Katuwang sa Diwa at Gawa para sa Masaganang Ani at Mataas na Kita (KADIWA) program in the City of Manila, in line with Republic Act No. 7160 or the “Local Government Code of 1991” and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Memorandum Circular No. 2024-003. The program is designed to foster inclusive economic growth by encouraging local business incubation, enterprise development, market linkages, and facilitating job creation and livelihood. As part of the National Government's efforts to alleviate the effects of the calamities, disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic and revive the economic growth and development of local enterprises, the Department of Agriculture (DA) launched the Katuwang sa Diwa at Gawa para sa Masaganang Ani at Mataas na Kita (KADIWA) program. This initiative aligns with the 2019 program of the Department of Agriculture (DA) by virtue of the ""Sagip Saka Act,” which promotes food security, sustainable local economic activities, and direct support to farmers, fisherfolk, and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

The KADIWA program, as an ordinance in the City of Manila, could significantly benefit residents by enhancing access to affordable and high-quality agricultural products while supporting local farmers. The program can reduce intermediaries and establish lower prices of goods for low-income households. Aside from promoting sustainability in the consumption of local products, this program supports public welfare goals, addressing food affordability and livelihood in the city.

This Ordinance shall provide a framework for the collaboration of various government agencies, including the Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and local government units (LGUs), to enhance the farm-to-consumer supply chain. By institutionalizing KADIWA, Manila aims to empower the local farming and business community through direct market access, delivery of affordable goods, and economic sustainability. This measure also seeks to promote food security and sustainability while benefiting both producers and consumers in the locality.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this Ordinance is earnestly sought.

Councilor, Second District
Manila

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. Title. — This Ordinance shall be known as “KADIWA Institutionalization Ordinance of the City of Manila.”

SEC. 2. Purpose. — This Ordinance is intended to institutionalize the implementation of KADIWA ng Pangulo (KNP) in the City of Manila in partnership with the Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), and Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) with the aim of attaining the following:
a. To ensure food security, stabilize prices, and guarantee availability of affordable, fresh, and nutritious food for the residents of the city;
b. To provide opportunity for MSMEs to market their products through local product promotion and eliminating as many marketing layers, allowing producers to earn bigger income directly selling their products instead of using trader-intermediaries;
c. To support local farmers and fisherfolk by providing them with a stable market for their product; and
d. To create a direct link between producers and consumers.

SEC. 3. Scope and Coverage. — For this purpose, the KNP shall cover three (3) market areas or product clusters, particularly:
a. Agricultural products, such as rice, vegetables, and fruits of farmers from various provinces;
b. Processed goods, both food and non-food, produced by MSMEs as One Town, One Product (OTOP) of different localities; and
c. Mercato stalls (ready-to-eat food) for micro-enterprises of the City of Manila.

SEC. 4. Definition of Terms. — The City Government of Manila shall establish and maintain KADIWA Outlet, a designated marketplace or facility where agricultural products are sold directly by farmers and fisherfolk to consumers, in strategic locations within the City, running every 15th and 30th of the month beginning January 30, 2024, to ensure accessibility to all residents.

As used in this Ordinance, KADIWA refers to Katuwang sa Diwa at Gawa para sa Masaganang Ani at Mataas na Kita (KADIWA), launched and spearheaded by the Department of Agriculture (DA) in 2019, in collaboration with farmers and enterprises registered in the Sagip Saka registry or Registry System for Basic Sectors Agriculture (RSBSA), which seeks to empower the farming community by providing a direct and effective farm-to-consumer food supply chain. The implementation of this program is reiterated by President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. during his State of the Nation Address (SONA), citing “The KNP system enabled the public to buy goods at cheaper rates and the farmers to sell their crops without having to worry about transportation costs.”

One Town, One Product (OTOP) is a priority stimulus program for Micro, Small, and Medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) as the government's intervention to drive inclusive local economic growth. Through the leadership of the Department of Trade and Industry, OTOP enables localities and communities to determine, develop, support, and promote products or services that are rooted in its local culture, community resources, creativity, connection, and competitive advantage.

SEC. 5. Content and Guidelines. —
a. KNP shall run every 15th and 30th of every month starting January 30, 2024.
b. The grand launch held on July 17, 2023, commenced the opening of KNP nationwide.
c. KNP shall have 3 market areas or product clusters:

Agricultural products such as rice, vegetables, and fruits of farmers for the various provinces;

Processed goods, both food and non-food products by MSMEs as OTOP products of different localities;

Mercato stalls (ready-to-eat food) for micro-enterprises of the host LGU.
d. The venue of the KNP may be in a closed or an open space area, provided there are available tents, tables, chairs. It should be well-ventilated and with areas that can accommodate stalls for selling products, an area for eating, and parking.
e. No registration fee shall be collected from participating farmer/MSME merchants nor from visiting consumers.

SEC. 6. Implementing Agency. — With the support of key implementing agencies within the Manila City Hall, the program seeks to strengthen local industries, empower farmers and MSMEs, and create accessible markets for high-quality, affordable products, benefiting both producers and the community.

AO No. 28 provided that granting a year-end Gratuity Pay to Contract of Service (COS) and Job Order (JO) workers is a well-deserved recognition of their hard work in implementing programs, projects, and activities, and their pivotal role in the delivery of government services amidst the present socio-economic challenges, considering that they do not enjoy benefits accorded to government employees as they have no employer-employee relationship with the government.

Section 5 of AO No. 28 mandated that local government units (LGUs) are enjoined to adopt in their respective offices the grant of Gratuity Pay to workers whose services are engaged through COS and JO, utilizing appropriate and available funding sources from their respective local government funds. The corresponding supplemental budget for the purpose shall be enacted by the local Sangguniang concerned within FY 2024.

Section 16 of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 provides that the LGUs shall exercise the powers that are essential to the promotion of general welfare. It shall ensure and support, among other things, the enhancement of economic prosperity, full employment, and social justice, and preserve the comfort and convenience of its inhabitants.

In view of the foregoing, I seek the support of my colleagues for the passage of this proposed ordinance.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF MANILA, IN SESSION ASSEMBLED, THAT:

It is therefore imperative to seek the support of my dear colleagues in this August Chamber.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:
SECTION 1. The re-scheduling of the City of Manila’s Five Billion Pesos (PhP5,000,000,000.00) Term Loan and Ten Billion Pesos (PhP10,000,000,000.00) Omnibus Loan from the Development Bank of the Philippines is hereby approved and ratified.

Delayed loan amortization payments,

AN ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING THE INCREASE IN THE COMPENSATION RATE FOR CONTRACT OF SERVICE PERSONNEL AND JOB ORDER WORKERS OF THE CITY OF MANILA AND AUGMENTING THE OTHER GENERAL SERVICES ACCOUNT THROUGH SAVINGS FROM THE FY 2024 ANNUAL BUDGET TO FUND ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES

EXPLANATORY NOTE

Section 77 of Republic Act No. 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 mandates the responsibility for human resources and development for local government units. It provides that the chief executive of every local government unit shall be responsible for human resources and development in his unit and shall take all personnel actions in accordance with the constitutional provisions on civil service, pertinent laws, and rules and regulations thereon, including such policies, guidelines, and standards as the Civil Service Commission may establish. Provided, that the local chief executive may employ emergency or casual employees or laborers paid on a daily wage or piecework basis and hired through job orders for local projects authorized by the Sangguniang concerned, without need of approval or attestation by the Civil Service Commission. Provided further, that the period of employment of emergency or casual laborers as provided in this section shall not exceed six (6) months.

The Commission on Audit - Department of Budget and Management Joint Circular (COA-DBM JC) No. 2, s. 2020, entitled ""Updated Rules and Regulations Governing Contract of Service (COS) and Job Order (JO) Workers in the Government,"" provides that government agencies are authorized to enter into service contracts with other government agencies, private firms, non-government agencies, or individuals for services related or incidental to their respective functions and operations, whether on a part-time or full-time basis.

The payment of services under individual COS is provided under Item 8.0 (Payment of Services under individual COS) of COA-DBM JC No. 2, s. 2020 and thus provides that individuals hired through COS shall be paid the prevailing market rates, subject to the provisions of RA No. 9184 and its Implementing Rules and Regulations. The same shall be charged against the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) in the approved agency budget.

In the same manner, the payment of services for those hired under the JO basis is charged against the MOOE in the approved agency budget and under Item 9.0 (Payment of Services under JO), individuals hired through JO shall be paid wages equivalent to the daily wage/salary of comparable positions in government and a premium of up to 20% of such wage/salary, subject to the availability of funds.

As the cost of goods and services has risen over time, an increase in the compensation of COS personnel and JO workers is necessary to help mitigate the impact of inflation and to enable them to meet their daily basic needs.

After due consideration, there is a need to augment the MOOE — Other General Services account, against which the compensation of COS personnel and JO workers are charged, through savings from other accounts of the FY 2024 Annual Budget to ensure the implementation of the increase in the aforementioned compensation rates.

The City Treasurer and the City Accountant have issued the Certificate of Availability of Funds/Cash as supporting documents to this savings and augmentation ordinance.

As provided under Section 336 of the Local Government Code of 1991, Use of Appropriated Funds and Savings, funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purpose for which they have been appropriated. No ordinance shall be passed authorizing any transfer of appropriations from one item to another. However, the local chief executive or the presiding officer of the Sangguniang concerned may, by ordinance, be authorized to augment an item in the approved annual budget for their respective offices from savings in other items within the same expense class of their respective appropriations.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

Section 322 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991, provides that:

""Unexpended balances of appropriations authorized in the annual appropriations ordinance shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund at the end of the fiscal year and shall not thereafter be available for expenditure except by subsequent enactment. However, appropriations for capital outlays shall continue and remain valid until fully spent, reverted, or the project is completed. Reversions of continuing appropriations shall not be allowed unless obligations therefor have been fully paid or otherwise settled.

The balances of continuing appropriations shall be reviewed as part of the annual budget preparation, and the Sangguniang concerned may approve, upon recommendation of the local chief executive, the reversion of funds no longer needed in connection with the activities funded by said continuing appropriations, subject to the provisions of this Section.""

Consistent with the foregoing statutory provision, there is a need to revert to the general fund the total amount of Eighty-Three Million Seventy-Six Thousand Pesos (PHP 83,076,000.00) under the Other General Services Account of the Office of the Sangguniang Panlungsod under the FY 2024 Annual Appropriations Ordinance, as the said fund is free from any obligation or encumbrance and still available to fund priority programs, activities, and projects for the general welfare of the residents of Manila.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
Tricycles have been one of the modes of transportation in the Philippines. They are accessible in both rural and urban areas but are usually seen within barangays and are considered essential, especially for daily commuters. Filipinos utilize tricycles to go to work, market, school, or any place since they are efficient and practical, as well as a hassle-free way to get to your desired location. Tricycles play a vital role in the movement of passengers, particularly in remote areas and/or subdivisions where other modes of transportation are not accessible to the public.

Under Section 16 of Republic Act 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, “Every local government unit shall exercise the powers expressly granted to them, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance, and those which are essential to the promotion of the general welfare of their people. Local Government Units shall then identify and designate viable routes and terminals within their jurisdiction and shall be in proximity to public buildings, public markets, commercial centers and other similar places in order to ensure accessibility to the public and to provide a better mode of transportation.”

The City Government of Manila recognizes the importance of maintaining order in traffic, decreasing congestion, and increasing accessibility and mobility of citizens, since this may also serve as an avenue for economic opportunities. Having an accessible mode of transportation such as tricycles also saves more travel time. In addition, due to their smaller size compared to other vehicles, they have the ability to negotiate narrow streets and maneuver more easily on crowded roads, providing door-to-door service.

This Ordinance seeks to include the Geronimo, G. Tuazon Tricycle Operators and Drivers Association (GERZONTODA), Inc. in the registered list of TODAs that can serve the public within their vicinity. This also includes their Route Measure Capacity, as well as their Loading and Unloading Areas.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this Ordinance is sought.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
Section 325(d) of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, provides that:
“In cases of abolition of positions and the creation of new ones resulting from the abolition of existing positions in the career service, such abolition or creation shall be made in accordance with pertinent provisions of this code and the civil service laws, rules and regulations.”

Furthermore, Section 76 of the same act provides that,
“Every local government unit shall design and implement its own organizational structure and staffing pattern taking into consideration its service requirements and financial capability, subject to the minimum standards and guidelines prescribed by the Civil Service Commission.”

The Office of the City Accountant (OCAT) is mandated to be in charge of both accounting and internal audit services of the city government in compliance with Section 474, Article IV, Title Five of Republic Act No. 7160 and the requirements of the Commission on Audit’s Philippine Public Sector Accounting System.

AN ORDINANCE INSTITUTIONALIZING KEY ASSISTANCE FOR DEVELOPING
ADOLESCENTS (KADA) IN THE CITY OF MANILA

EXPLANATORY NOTE
The 1987 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines declares that the State shall protect and promote the right to health of the people and instill health consciousness among them.

The 1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) recognizes adolescents as active rights holders who have the capacity to become full and responsible citizens, given appropriate guidance and direction.

The 1990 CRC provides adolescents the right to be informed, to express an informed view, to have that view taken into account, and to be the main or joint decision-maker in all decisions directly affecting them.

The Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act No. 7160) accords every local government unit power and authority to promote the general welfare within its territorial jurisdiction, including the promotion of health and safety of its constituents.

The Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10354) utilizes a rights-based approach to educate, disseminate information, and assess the capacity to make informed decisions on sexual and reproductive health matters. R.A. 10354 mandates that ""the State shall eradicate discriminatory practices, laws, and policies that infringe on a person's exercise of reproductive health rights.""

The Philippines Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) Policy Act of 2018 (Republic Act No. 11166) ensures the delivery of non-discriminatory HIV and AIDS services by government and private HIV and AIDS service providers, and develops redress mechanisms for persons living with HIV to ensure that their civil, political, economic, and social rights are protected.

The Universal Health Care Act of 2018 (Republic Act No. 11223) embodies the principle of an integrated and comprehensive approach to ensure that all Filipinos are health literate, provided with healthy living conditions, and protected from hazards and risks that could affect their health. It directs local government units to issue and implement effective health promotion policies and programs that promote health literacy and healthy lifestyles among their constituents, prioritizing programs that address key risk factors to prevent and control disease as well as to advance population health and individual well-being, inclusive of interventions addressing sexual and reproductive health matters.

The Department of Health (DOH) Administrative Order (AO) No. 2011-0005 emphasizes that health service providers should provide accurate and complete information on family planning methods and services, crucial to informed choice and voluntary decision-making, as well as individual rights to access quality family planning services.

DOH AO No. 2013-0013 aims to improve the health status of adolescents and to enable them to fully enjoy their right to health by ensuring that all adolescents have access to quality and comprehensive health care and services in adolescent-friendly environments, and by enabling adolescent behavior change, including increased service utilization, adoption of healthy behaviors, and avoidance of risky behaviors.
WHEREAS, the Health Promotion Framework Strategy (HPFS) takes a life course approach and prioritizes health promotion for the youth, who, when encouraged to develop healthy, health-promoting, and health-seeking behavior, can carry this into adulthood to become responsible citizens, and acknowledges sexual and reproductive health (SRH) as one of the seven priority areas of action for the next ten (10) years.

The City of Manila is aware of existing and emerging sexual and reproductive health concerns of adolescents, such as STI or HIV infection, early sexual initiation, unwanted or adolescent pregnancy, sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, and poorer health outcomes associated with these; and of various barriers that make sexual and reproductive health knowledge and services difficult to acquire.

Owing to the aforementioned, the City of Manila acknowledges the need for a strongly-supported, well-coordinated, multisectoral development approach to minimize environmental risks and risky sexual behavior, and ensure adolescent sexual and reproductive health.
SECTION 1. Short Title. — This Ordinance shall be known as the KADA Ordinance of 2024.

SEC. 2. Declaration of Principles and Policies. — It is the policy of the City of Manila to ensure that the rights of adolescents, their sexual and reproductive health, and their well-being are always protected, exercised, and realized.

Furthermore, the City adheres to the belief that adolescents can practice healthy behaviors and avoid health risks, can access and utilize health services, and can freely participate in governance and policy decision-making processes affecting their health and development.

Towards this end, the City of Manila shall adopt the following:

a. A participatory approach toward the implementation of adolescent health and development programs, that respects and encourages the practice of adolescents' rights, their participation in their communities, and their evolving capacity to make intelligent and responsible decisions, as guided by appropriate values;

b. A life course approach that recognizes that adolescents, like any other age group, have the right to achieve the highest attainable standard of health, among other rights; and that adolescents who are encouraged to build healthy habits in an enabling environment early on can become healthy and productive members of society;

c. An adolescent-oriented approach that positively addresses adolescents' needs and concerns; that ensures privacy, confidentiality, flexibility, and non-discrimination and avoidance of stigma; and that seeks to eradicate conditions which aggravate sexual and reproductive health concerns of adolescents, including poverty, educational inequity, gender and age-related inequality, and marginalization; and,

d. A settings-based approach that ensures adolescent-friendly environments with comprehensive, quality, and trustworthy service providers and service-delivery networks to guide and enable the aforementioned.

SEC. 3. General Objectives. — This Ordinance seeks to:
a) Promote among service providers and focal government frontliners positive messages and practices that encourage trust among adolescent clients while providing them with clear, accurate guidance on sexual and reproductive health matters;
b) Mobilize the community to promote adolescents' sexual and reproductive health in accordance with their evolving capacities, by creating enabling integrated environments which promote healthy behaviors, the avoidance of risky behaviors, and the utilization of adolescent-oriented services.

SEC. 4. Definition of Terms. — For the purpose of this Ordinance, the following are operationally defined:

a. Adolescents shall refer to people between the ages of 10 and 19 years, who are in transition from childhood to adulthood, and are the primary targets of this Ordinance, differentiated from 'youth' or 'young people';

b. Adolescent Health and Development shall refer to the state of complete physical and psycho-social functioning of persons aged 10-19 years and 20-30 years old;

c. Adolescent-friendly facilities, also referred to as KADA Centers, shall refer to facilities that provide equitable, accessible, acceptable, appropriate, effective, quality, and comprehensive health care services in an adolescent-friendly environment.

d. Early or adolescent pregnancy shall refer to pregnancy in girls younger than 20 years old.

e.

a. For religious reasons — Certification from an authorized church official
b. For medical reasons — Certification from a government physician
c. For personal principles — Certification from the parent/guardian assuming responsibility for the child's health

Children entering the Child Development Center, aged three (3) to four (4) years old, who have not been fully vaccinated, shall receive catch-up vaccines for Mumps, Measles, Rubella (MMR), and Oral Polio.

Until 9:00 A.M.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

The City of Manila recognizes the importance of physical activities in promoting a healthy and active lifestyle among its constituents, while also maintaining harmony with the city's natural and man-made environment. This led to the creation of the MOVE MANILA Program.

According to Section 21(a) of the Local Government Code of 1991, a local government unit may, through an ordinance, temporarily close or open any local road, alley, park, or square within its jurisdiction.

Participating in carless programs like walking, jogging, running, and cycling has several health benefits, including:

Increased Physical Activity: Encourages regular exercise, improving cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of obesity.

Reduced Air Pollution Exposure: By reducing reliance on cars, these programs help lower air pollution, improving respiratory health and reducing asthma rates.

Improved Mental Well-being: Active transportation methods like walking or cycling can boost mood and reduce stress levels, contributing to better mental health.

Lowered Risk of Chronic Diseases: Regular physical activity helps prevent chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.

Enhanced Community Engagement: Walking and cycling encourage social interaction and strengthen community bonds, positively affecting emotional well-being.

The 1987 Constitution of the Philippines, Article XII, Section 11, states that the State shall adopt an integrated approach to health development, making essential services available to all at an affordable cost. Article XIV, Section 19 states that the State shall promote physical education and encourage sports programs to foster self-discipline, teamwork, and the development of a healthy citizenry.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1: Short Title
This Ordinance shall be known as the Move Manila Ordinance, a motor-vehicle and pollution-free health and wellness program for the City of Manila.

SECTION 2: Purpose
The Move Manila Program encourages Filipinos to engage in age-appropriate physical activities, in line with the Philippine National Guidelines on Physical Activity (2010) by the Department of Health (DOH). It also promotes mental well-being, as stated in the Mental Health Act (Republic Act 11036).

The program supports the Supreme Court's continuing mandate regarding Manila Bay, promoting environmental awareness and making the Manila Bay area an integral part of a livable and walkable city. The program also aligns with Manila's tourism goals, promoting the natural beauty of Manila Bay, its world-famous view, and the architectural design of Roxas Boulevard.

SECTION 3: Implementation
The City of Manila will temporarily close a portion of Roxas Boulevard (both North and South Bound) from Padre Burgos Avenue to Quirino Avenue every Sunday from 5:00 A.M. to 9:00 A.M. to promote health and wellness through a pollution-free fitness program.

SECTION 4: Contingencies
Traffic flow during the closure will be carefully managed by the appropriate agencies to ensure timely travel and efficient delivery of goods and services. Light motor vehicles will be diverted to parallel service roads, while heavy motor vehicles will be rerouted to main thoroughfares like Taft Avenue.

Emergency responders and hydration stations will be placed along Roxas Boulevard to support program participants and the public. Waste management measures will be implemented before and after each event to ensure a clean and healthy environment.

SECTION 5: Key Agencies
The following agencies will coordinate the safe and efficient implementation of the Move Manila Program:

Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB) - Lead Agency

Manila Sports Council (MASCO)

Manila Health Department (MHD)

Department of Public Services - Manila (DPS)

Manila Disaster and Risk Reduction Management Office (MDRRMO)

Manila Barangay Bureau (MBB)

SECTION 7: Repealing Clause
All ordinances, rules, and regulations in conflict with this Ordinance are hereby repealed or amended accordingly.

SECTION 8: Effectivity Clause

AN ORDINANCE FURTHER AMENDING SECTION 1 AND SECTION 2 OF ORDINANCE NO. 6507, AS AMENDED BY ORDINANCE NO. 7716, AND INSERTING SEVERAL SECTIONS THERETO

EXPLANATORY NOTE
There have been instances in the past and recent times wherein law enforcement units/elements, in the guise of an inspection, ended in business owners being harassed, which gave rise to the enactment of City Ordinance No. 6507, amended by Ordinance No. 7716.

Section 1 of Ordinance No. 7716 clearly shows that the prohibition to inspect business establishments in the City of Manila, for the purpose of enforcing sanitary rules and regulations, as well as their licenses and permits, and/or enforcing internal revenue and customs laws and regulations, applies solely to the then Western Police District (WPD), now the Manila Police District.

The said provision is restrictive and insufficient in character as it does not cover other law enforcement agencies who may commit the proscribed act, thereby rendering the efforts of the City Government of Manila to avert police harassment — the very evil that Ordinance No. 7716 seeks to deter.

Perusal of Section 2 of Ordinance No. 6507 likewise reveals the inadequacy of the penalties for its violation to prevent, preclude, and stop the corruption resulting from police harassment, as well as in securing and protecting owners and operators of business establishments in the City of Manila.

Considering that Ordinance No. 6507 and Ordinance No. 7716 are both deficient and lack coercive power to deter police personnel from violating their commandments, it will have a deleterious effect on the business sector and the public welfare unless revised, improved, and modified.

Section 5, Article II of the 1987 Philippine Constitution declares that the maintenance of peace and order, the protection of life, liberty and property, and the promotion of general welfare are essential for the enjoyment by all the people of the blessings of democracy.

Section 16 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, emphatically declares that “every local government unit shall exercise the powers expressly granted, those necessarily implied therefrom, as well as powers necessary, appropriate, or incidental for its efficient and effective governance, and those which are essential to the promotion of the general welfare.”

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:
SECTION 1. PROHIBITED ACTS. — Section 1 of Ordinance No. 6507, as amended by Ordinance No. 7716, is hereby further amended to read as follows:
“Section 1. No member of the Philippine National Police and other law enforcement agencies shall conduct inspection of any store, business, industrial, and commercial establishments in the City of Manila, including, but not limited to, permits and licenses duly and regularly issued to them by the City Government of Manila, for the purpose of or in the guise of enforcing sanitary, internal revenue, and customs laws, rules, and regulations without proper coordination with, knowledge and assistance of, and authority from the concerned departments, bureaus, and offices of the National or Local Government, as the case may be, pursuant to existing and applicable guidelines.”

SEC. 2. PENALTIES. — Section 2 of Ordinance No. 6507 is hereby amended to read as follows:
“Sec. 2. Any violation of this Ordinance shall be punishable as follows:
FIRST OFFENSE: A fine of One Thousand Pesos (PhP 1,000.00) or imprisonment of not less than 10 days or more than 30 days, or both, at the discretion of the court.

SECOND OFFENSE: A fine of Three Thousand Pesos (PhP 3,000.00) or imprisonment of not less than 20 days nor more than 30 days, or both, at the discretion of the court.

THIRD AND SUCCEEDING OFFENSES: A fine of Five Thousand Pesos (PhP 5,000.00) and imprisonment of not less than 1 month nor more than 6 months, or both, at the discretion of the court.”

SEC. 3. SHORT TITLE. — This Ordinance shall now be known and cited as the “Anti-Business Harassment Ordinance of 2024” for brevity.

SEC. 4. SCOPE. — This Ordinance shall cover all employees, uniformed personnel, and units of the Philippine National Police (PNP) and other law enforcement agencies.

SEC. 5. DEFINITION OF TERMS. — As used in this Ordinance, the following shall mean:
•        a) Store — any business facility that sells goods directly to the consumer including, but not limited to, retail shops, restaurants, pharmacies, and supermarkets, whether seasonal or temporary;
•        b) Business Establishment — any person, natural or juridical, whether single proprietorship or corporation, engaged in or doing business, either in selling goods or providing services;
•        c) Commercial Establishment — any establishment where people are employed to provide services or do office work, including, but not limited to, banks, insurance and trading companies, hotels, cafes, boarding houses, dormitories, and institutions of similar nature;
•        d) Industrial Establishment — any establishment engaged in manufacturing or processing business, including, but not limited to, factories, slaughterhouses, mills, refineries, processing plants, and enterprises of similar nature;
•        e) Law Enforcement Agency — any government agency responsible for the enforcement of laws, as well as discovering, deterring, rehabilitating, or penalizing those violating the same.

SEC. 6. SEPARABILITY CLAUSE.  —  In the event any part or provision of this Ordinance is declared illegal or invalid, other parts or provisions hereof which are not affected thereby shall remain valid and in full force and effect.

SEC. 7. REPEALING CLAUSE. —  All previous ordinances and rules/regulations which are inconsistent with the provisions of this Ordinance are hereby deemed modified or repealed accordingly.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVITY CLAUSE. — This Ordinance shall take effect after all requirements for official posting prescribed in Section 511 of R.A. No. 7160, otherwise known as “The Local Government Code of 1991”, have been met.

This Ordinance was finally enacted by the City Council of Manila on February 13, 2024.
","The Manila City Council updated an ordinance to strengthen protections for business owners against harassment by police and other law enforcement during inspections. Law enforcers are now prohibited from inspecting business permits or licenses without proper coordination and approval from the concerned government offices.

AN ORDINANCE BEQUEATHING HONORS TO THE LATE VICE MAYOR DANILO B. LACUNA BY NAMING THE AUDITORIUM OF THE MAIN BUILDING OF DR. ALEJANDRO ALBERT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN HIS NAME, LOCATED AT 2110 DAPITAN STREET IN THE FOURTH DISTRICT OF MANILA

EXPLANATORY NOTE

The late Vice Mayor Danilo Bautista Lacuna is an icon in the City of Manila. He once served as an alderman representing what was then the 4th District of Manila from 1967 to 1975 during the now-defunct Manila Municipal Board.

During his stint as Vice Mayor, he spearheaded the passage of notable ordinances that truly benefited the Manileños.

Danny Lacuna, as he is fondly addressed by his peers, is not only the founder of the ruling local party Asenso Manileño but also the father of successful children in their respective fields.

He was always fair and proactive in dealing with his contemporaries in the City Council. He was a friend to all and enemy to none, regardless of political affiliation.

It is only fitting to immortalize the man as a simple token of gratitude for his indelible contribution to the progress of the City of Manila.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. The auditorium of the main building of Dr. Alejandro Albert Elementary School, located at 2110 Dapitan Street in the Fourth District of the City of Manila, shall hereby be named the ""DANILO B. LACUNA AUDITORIUM.""

SEC. 2. The City Engineer of Manila is hereby directed to cause the installation of markers/signages in conspicuous corners visible to the naked eye along the specified hallway.

SEC. 3. Copies of this Ordinance shall be furnished to the Department of Education, the Division of City Schools, the Office of the Mayor, and the City Engineer's Office.

SEC. 4. Effectivity Clause. — This Ordinance shall take effect upon its approval.

The title of the Ordinance should be corrected to read as follows:
""An Ordinance Bequeathing Honors to the Late Vice Mayor Danilo B. Lacuna by Naming the Auditorium of the Main Building of Dr. Alejandro Albert Elementary School in His Name, Located at 2110 Dapitan Street in the Fourth District of Manila.""

Furthermore, in Section 1, the word ""Hallway"" must be replaced with ""Auditorium."" The corrected section shall read as follows:

SECTION 1. The auditorium of the main building of Dr. Alejandro Albert Elementary School, located at 2110 Dapitan Street in the Fourth District of the City of Manila, shall hereby be named the ""DANILO B. LACUNA AUDITORIUM.""

We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.

","This ordinance honors the late Vice Mayor Danilo B. Lacuna for his outstanding public service and contributions to the City of Manila. As a tribute, the auditorium of the main building of Dr. Alejandro Albert Elementary School, located at 2110 Dapitan Street, Fourth District, Manila, is officially named the ""DANILO B. LACUNA AUDITORIUM.""

Vice Mayor Lacuna was a respected leader and legislator who authored meaningful ordinances and was known for his fairness and dedication. He also founded the local political group Asenso Manileño and raised children who have succeeded in their respective fields.

The City Engineer of Manila is tasked with installing visible markers or signages displaying the new name of the auditorium.

Copies of this ordinance will be given to the Department of Education, the Division of City Schools, the Office of the Mayor, and the City Engineer's Office for implementation.

This ordinance takes effect immediately upon approval.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
Ordinance No. 8919 appropriated funds for various items under the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of the FY 2023 Annual Budget.

However, after due consideration, there is a need to augment certain items through savings from other accounts within the FY 2023 Annual Budget to ensure the effective and continuous delivery of priority programs, activities, and basic services in the City of Manila.

The City Treasurer and the City Accountant have issued a Declaration of Savings as supporting documentation for the said savings and augmentation.

As provided under Section 336 of the Local Government Code (Use of Appropriated Funds and Savings), funds shall be available exclusively for the specific purposes for which they have been appropriated. No ordinance shall be passed authorizing any transfer of appropriations from one item to another. However, the local chief executive or the presiding officer of the Sangguniang concerned may, by ordinance, be authorized to augment an item in the approved annual budget for their respective offices from savings in other items within the same expense class of their respective appropriations.

The various offices, bureaus, and departments of the City Government of Manila require the use of basic utilities for daily operations. Hence, to maintain proper and continuous operations, augmentation of the accounts Electricity Expenses and Water Expenses is deemed necessary.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

This Ordinance seeks to authorize the acquisition of certain privately-owned real properties through negotiation.

The undersigned is much aware of the enduring need of residents validly occupying the said subject properties, which has lasted in terms of decades but without financial resources, to secure for themselves the ownership of properties. In order to address such situation, the City Government of Manila, invoking the General Welfare Clause of the Local Government Code, would take the initiative by way of a land acquisition agreement with the subject of the property owners for the benefit of the residents, it being part of the Land-for-the-Landless Program of Manila, hence the proposed measure.
Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. Requirements before negotiation. — The favorable recommendations of the following offices are hereby required before the start of the negotiation for the acquisition of land for beneficiaries under the Land-for-the-Landless Program of the City of Manila:

AN ORDINANCE MANDATING THE INSTALLATION OF AUDIBLE TRAFFIC SIGNALS AND PUSH BUTTONS WITH BRAILLE TO ASSIST PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES, SENIOR CITIZENS, AND PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE CITY OF MANILA

EXPLANATORY NOTE
When it is safe to cross the street, an electronic device called an audible traffic signal produces a sound for pedestrians. It is frequently used alongside visual cues such as flashing ""Don't Walk"" signs. This ordinance aims to support the independence and safety of blind or visually impaired individuals, along with senior citizens and pregnant women, by requiring the installation of auditory traffic signals and Braille-enabled push buttons.

These features will help increase accessibility, safety, and inclusivity in the City of Manila's transportation system. It is the policy of the City Government to promote the self-reliance, rehabilitation, and development of these vulnerable sectors.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:
SECTION 1. Declaration of Policy.
It is hereby declared the policy of the City Government of Manila to adopt measures that ensure the independence, recovery, and personal growth of persons with disabilities (PWDs). The city shall uphold the rights of pregnant women, senior citizens, and PWDs to live normal lives through policies that protect their health and safety.

SEC. 2. Objectives.
This Ordinance specifically aims to: a) Further reduce traffic congestion and improve traffic flow;
b) Protect public and driver safety; and
c) Ensure the security of elderly individuals, pregnant women, and pedestrians with disabilities.

SEC. 3. Audible Traffic Signal.
An Audible Traffic Signal provides information on the status and location of pedestrian light signals for the blind and visually impaired. It functions through synchronized sounds (“back and forth call operation”) emitted from two speakers placed at each end of the crosswalk during the walk signal phase.

SEC. 4. Scope.
This Ordinance mandates the installation of audible traffic signals with Braille push buttons for PWDs, senior citizens, and pregnant women at all pedestrian crossings with traffic signals within the jurisdiction of the City of Manila.

SEC. 5. Push Buttons for PWDs, Senior Citizens, and Pregnant Women.
Pressing the push button activates the traffic light’s countdown timer, allowing sufficient time to cross safely. The Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB) shall conduct time and motion studies to determine appropriate crossing durations for the intended users.

SEC. 6. Penalty.
The push buttons are reserved solely for PWDs, senior citizens, and pregnant women. Any person found guilty of tampering with or misusing the Audible Traffic Signal shall be fined ₱5,000.00 and/or face imprisonment of at least 30 days, subject to the court’s discretion.

SEC. 7. Implementing Agency.
The Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB) shall be the implementing agency of this Ordinance.

SEC. 8. Separability Clause.
If any part or provision of this Ordinance is declared invalid or unconstitutional, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

SEC. 9. Repealing Clause.
All ordinances, decrees, orders, rules, and regulations inconsistent with this Ordinance are hereby repealed or modified accordingly.

SEC. 10. Effectivity Clause.
This Ordinance shall take effect fifteen (15) days after its publication in at least two (2) newspapers of general circulation.

This Ordinance was finally enacted by the City Council of Manila on November 14, 2023.","This ordinance requires the City of Manila to install traffic lights that make sound and have Braille push buttons at pedestrian crossings. These special traffic lights will help blind or visually impaired people, senior citizens, and pregnant women cross the street more safely.

EEXPLANATORY NOTE

Section 322 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991, categorically provides:

""Section 322. Reversion of Unexpended Balances of Appropriations, Continuing Appropriations. — Unexpended balances of appropriations authorized in the annual appropriations ordinance shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the general fund at the end of the fiscal year and shall not thereafter be available for expenditure except by subsequent enactment. However, appropriations for capital outlays shall continue and remain valid until fully spent, reverted or the project is completed. Reversions of continuing appropriations shall not be allowed unless obligations therefor have been fully paid or otherwise settled.

The balances of continuing appropriations shall be reviewed as part of the annual budget preparation and the sanggunian concerned may approve, upon recommendation of the local chief executive, the reversion of funds no longer needed in connection with the activities funded by said continuing appropriations subject to the provisions of this Section.""

Particular amounts were appropriated for the various projects of the City of Manila under Capital Outlay (CO) — 20% Development Fund of the FY 2023 Annual Budget. However, in line with the promotion of the general welfare of the residents of Manila, there is a need to amend the identified projects under the said 20% Development Fund.

City Ordinance No. 8919 previously appropriated funds for various items under the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses (MOOE) of the FY 2023 Annual Executive Budget.

However, after further review, certain items require augmentation through savings from other accounts in order to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of priority programs, activities, and basic services in the City of Manila.

The City Treasurer and City Accountant have issued the Certificate of Availability of Funds/Cash, validating the existence of savings available for augmentation.

Under Section 336 of the Local Government Code, while appropriated funds must be used for their specific purposes, local chief executives or the presiding officer of the Sangguniang concerned may, by ordinance, be authorized to augment an item from savings within the same expense class of their appropriations.

Improvement of the Manila Zoo

To cover the interest payments for these loans, the City Accountant has requested additional funds based on the projected 4th Quarter loan amortization. As such, the augmentation of funds under Financial Expenses — Interest Expenses, listed under the Special Purpose Appropriations (SPA), is necessary.

The City Council approved Resolution No. 3, Series of 2023, of the Executive Committee of the City Development Council, entitled:

“A Resolution Approving the Amendment of the Annual Investment Program and the Issuance of a Supplemental Investment Program for FY 2023 in Relation to the Augmentation of an Item under the Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses — Special Purpose Appropriations, in the Total Amount of One Hundred Seventy Million Pesos (₱170,000,000.00).”

AN ORDINANCE MANDATING ALL CONSTRUCTION AND CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIERS WITHIN THE CITY OF MANILA TO PLACE SAND, GRAVEL, AND EXCAVATED DEBRIS IN BAGS OR PROPER CONTAINERS, PREVENTING THE USAGE OF THE CITY STREETS AND SIDEWALKS FOR STORAGE/HOLDING AREAS THAT CAUSE EROSION AND OBSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC UTILITIES

EXPLANATORY NOTE
Instead of the customary use of public spaces such as streets and sidewalks as temporary storage areas for sand, gravel, and excavated soil and debris, which become obstructions, proper storage methods are now mandated.

One factor causing silt, sediment, sludge, and residues through erosion in our drainage systems is consistently reducing their efficiency by 30% to 80%, rendering many drainage systems ineffective.

Section 1102, Storage in Public Property, under Chapter 11 of the rules and regulations implementing Presidential Decree No. 1096 or the National Building Code of the Philippines, provides that materials and equipment necessary for work to be done under a permit, when placed or stored on public property, shall not obstruct free and convenient access to and use of any fire hydrant, fire or police alarm box, utility box, catch basin, or manhole, and shall not interfere with drainage in any street or alley gutter.

The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), together with the city, have been tasked to dredge waterways and conduct de-clogging efforts to prevent frequent flooding in the busy streets of Manila.

A report from the DPWH states that the Philippines has suffered several severe floods, causing financial losses to the government. The primary cause of flooding is the filling of inland waterways with sediments and trash due to upstream erosion and waste dumping, which reduces the water-carrying capacity of the drainage system.

The complete solution to flooding involves increasing the holding capacity of floodwater catch basins and widening large pipes/culverts as waterways. However, the most effective maintenance solution is sustaining efficiency by reducing sediments and silt.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. This Ordinance shall be known as “AN ORDINANCE FOR THE PROPER HANDLING OF CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS, SAND, AND GRAVEL IN ALL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WITHIN THE CITY OF MANILA.”

SEC. 2. Basis.
Large construction developments shall provide proper storage areas, such as containers or receptacles, to prevent the erosion of materials. In the absence of such storage, eroding supplies must be placed in nylon or similar bags to be properly contained. As stated in the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the National Building Code (Presidential Decree No. 1096), materials and equipment necessary for work under a permit, when placed or stored on public property, shall not obstruct free and convenient access to or use of any fire hydrant, fire or police alarm box, utility box, catch basin, or manhole, and shall not interfere with the drainage of any street, alley, or gutter, ensuring the smooth flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.

SEC. 3. Implementing Agencies.
The Building Official/Engineering Department and other law enforcement agencies shall administer the implementation and full compliance with Section 2 by contractors or owners of structures where construction or repairs are taking place.

SEC. 4. Penalties.
It shall be the duty of the implementing departments stated in Section 3 to inspect for immediate compliance with Section 2. If non-compliance is found during inspection, the following penalties will apply:

First Offense: Fine of Two Thousand Pesos (PhP 2,000.00)

Second Offense: Fine of Three Thousand Pesos (PhP 3,000.00)

Third Offense: Fine of Five Thousand Pesos (PhP 5,000.00) and suspension of the permit

EXPLANATORY NOTE

Section 458 (5) (vi) of Republic Act No. 7160, or the Local Government Code of 1991, empowers the City, through an ordinance, to regulate traffic on all streets and bridges within the city territory.

Ordinance No. 8676 implemented the No Contact Apprehension Program (NCAP), which enforced traffic rules and regulations by operating a 24-hour NCAP to ensure round-the-clock compliance with traffic ordinances and rules.

Section 4 of the ordinance defined NCAP as a systematic program where the City apprehends traffic violators using state-of-the-art, evidence-based, and comprehensive technology without the need for physical contact with traffic enforcers.

Section 9 of the ordinance created the NCAP Trust Fund, where fines collected from traffic violations under the program would be placed. The Trust Fund is separate from the City’s General Fund and other trust funds for different purposes. The Trust Fund has its own bank account, to which the City has access for implementing NCAP, either on its own or through a Joint Venture or Service Agreement, to be determined by the City.

Furthermore, Section 3(1) of the same ordinance provides that the Trust Fund Review and Approval Committee of NCAP shall be responsible for documentation and liquidation of the Trust Fund proceeds, subject to applicable rules and regulations from the Commission on Audit and other relevant laws.

Currently, the accumulated NCAP Trust Fund has a balance of P152,448,362.50, net of any service fees or charges for NCAP implementation.

Meanwhile, monies from the General Fund have been used to finance the operational requirements of the Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB). For FY 2023, the Executive Budget appropriated P178,880,905 for MTPB operations.

Given that the NCAP Trust Fund balance has remained unutilized since January 2021, it can be reasonably used to replenish the General Fund, which has been depleted to fund MTPB operations. This will free up funds to finance priority programs, projects, and activities under the FY 2023 Executive Budget, such as the City’s Social Amelioration Program for senior citizens, persons with disabilities, solo parents, Grade 12 public school students, and college students at Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila and Universidad de Manila.

BE IT ORDAINED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF MANILA, IN SESSION ASSEMBLED:

SECTION 1. Amendments. - Section 9 of Ordinance No. 8676 is hereby amended and shall now be read as follows:

“SEC. 9. No Contact Apprehension Program Trust Fund. — There is hereby created a ‘No Contact Apprehension Program Trust Fund.’ The fines collected by the City for violations of traffic laws under the Program shall be placed in this Trust Fund, which is separate and distinct from the General Fund of the City and all other Trust Funds created for different purposes. This Trust Fund shall have its own bank account, to which the City has access for implementing NCAP, either by the City itself or through a Joint Venture or Service Agreement, as determined by the City.

Any unused balance at the end of each month, in excess of the expenditures for NCAP implementation, shall be automatically transferred to the General Fund to finance the City’s Executive Budget.”

SECTION 2. Separability Clause. — If for any reason, any part of this Ordinance is declared unconstitutional or invalid, the remaining parts or provisions thereof, which are not affected, shall remain valid and in full force and effect.

SECTION 3. Repealing Clause. — All existing ordinances, executive orders, and administrative regulations or parts thereof, which are inconsistent with any provision of this Ordinance, are hereby repealed or modified accordingly.

SECTION 4. Effectivity Clause. — This Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its approval.

This Ordinance was finally enacted by the City Council of Manila on September 14, 2023.

AN ORDINANCE ABOLISHING THREE (3) POSITIONS TO GIVE WAY TO THE CREATION OF FIVE (5) ESSENTIAL POSITIONS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF ASSESSMENT

EXPLANATORY NOTE

Effective records management is essential to preserving and utilizing records with long-term value for future generations. It is crucial to manage these records properly from creation to disposal.

The Department of Assessment has recently digitized all tax records, including the Tax Declarations (TDs), FAASes, and supporting documents for approximately 450 real property units in the city. These records cover revision years 1979, 1985, 1996, 2005, and 2014.

The Department has reached its maximum storage capacity for tax records. As a result, there is a pressing need to gradually archive these files to create a more efficient workspace for employees and ensure ease of access for the taxpaying public. The processing of transactions is still done manually before being digitized and added to the in-house system, contributing to the increasing volume of physical files in storage.

To preserve these vital documents and protect them from potential damage caused by natural and man-made disasters, it is necessary to return all scanned files to their respective folders, bind the documents, and archive them properly.

To address this, it is proposed to create lower-grade positions that do not require eligibility for bookbinding, proper inventory, monitoring of record movements, and maintaining the cleanliness of the archives room. These positions will help facilitate the digital transformation and protect records without the need for additional funding.

Therefore, three existing positions in the Department of Assessment will be abolished to create five new essential positions.

The letter outlined violations by BASECOTODA of laws and regulations promulgated by the City of Manila. The MTPB's letter stated:

After a thorough investigation of the complaints against BASECO and the examination of submitted evidence, the undersigned, by virtue of the power granted by Ordinance No. 8291 (otherwise known as the ""MANILATRIWHEEL VEHICLE ORDINANCE OF 2012""), which grants this office the power to ""receive, process, commence, investigate and submit to the Sangguniang Panlungsod the suspension or revocation of franchises or permits,"" hereby endorses the revocation of BASECOTODA as a valid TODA existing and operating within the City of Manila and requests the City Council to dissolve it for the benefit of the public.

On August 1, 2023, the City Legal Officer issued a memorandum to Hon. Jesus ""Taga"" Fajardo, Jr., Chairman of the Committee on Transportation, regarding the revocation of BASECOTODA's franchise. The memorandum emphasized that:

It is clear that the power to grant franchises belongs to the City Council of Manila, and thus, the power to cancel or revoke the same also lies with the City Council. A franchise is a special privilege granted by a governmental authority and is not a common right. If a franchise violates the terms and conditions, it can be revoked by the City Council.

AN ORDINANCE INSTITUTIONALIZING AWARDS TO BE GIVEN BY THE SANGGUNIANG PANLUNGSOD NG MAYNILA TO ITS ERSTWHILE AND CURRENT MEMBERS WHO HAVE RENDERED EXCEPTIONAL AND UNBLEMISHED SERVICE TO THE CITY.

EXPLANATORY NOTE

On September 21, 1972, the entire country was placed under Martial Law by virtue of Presidential Proclamation 1081, resulting in the abolition of all legislative councils, including the then Manila Municipal Board. This hiatus lasted for fourteen years.

With the ratification of the 1987 Constitution, the 1st City Council was elected on January 18, 1988, with its tenure starting on February 2, 1988, and ending on June 30, 1992. This council was composed of six districts, as opposed to the pre-martial law composition of four districts. Each district elects six councilors, making a total of thirty-six elected councilors in the City of Manila. The Local Government Code of 1991 also provides for two additional sectoral representatives, representing the Liga ng mga Barangay and the Sangguniang Kabataan Federation.

On several occasions, aldermen or secretaries of local councils from other parts of the country have visited this Body to seek references on measures that they would pass in their localities.

As the national capital, our city continues to be the primary source of information on local legislation, as this Body has existed since the Spanish Colonial period.

It is sorrowful to note that decades later, many statutes crafted by past members of this Body were lost in the battle for the liberation of Manila in 1945. However, many survived the massive carpet bombing by the Allied Forces and are now preserved in the city’s statute books.

This current membership of this august Chamber recognizes the sacrifices and hard work of its past members. With sincere privilege, a program to give recognition and awards to the distinguished past and current members of the Manila City Council, who have carved a niche in the annals of history of our beloved city, has been crafted.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. Awards and Recognition - The following awards and recognitions to be given to the erstwhile and current members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila shall hereby be institutionalized, to wit:

DANGAL NG KONSEHO AWARD
The highest recognition given to past and current members of the Manila City Council (Vice-Mayor or Councilor) who have rendered exemplary service to the Council and the City of Manila, adding great honor and prestige to the Council as an institution or contributing to the lasting benefit of the people of Manila.

PERLAS NG KONSEHO AWARD
A recognition given to a City Councilor for political merit, for having dedicated the most number of years in service to the people of Manila as a member of the City Council.

TIMBULAN NG LAYA AWARD

This is particularly in recognition of outstanding dedication to the democratic way of life, the rule of law, good governance, defense of truth and freedom, peaceful resolution of conflict, and other meritorious political and civic service.

DIWANG DAKILA AWARD
A posthumous award given in memory of a former member of the Manila City Council, or in exceptional cases, its employees and staff, who had rendered invaluable service and acts worthy of recognition for fostering, developing, and strengthening the honor and prestige of the City Council as an institution.

SEC. 2. Awardees — The list of awardees shall be prepared by a committee created by virtue of this Ordinance, and must pass the unanimous approval of the Sanggunian through a resolution.

SEC. 3. Effectivity Clause. — This Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its approval.

This Ordinance was finally enacted by the City Council of Manila on July 25, 2023.","This ordinance creates a system of awards to honor both past and present members of the Manila City Council (which includes the Vice-Mayor and Councilors) who have provided outstanding and unblemished service to the city.

Studies show that infants and young children are the most susceptible to malnutrition, which has affected thousands of children and, if not prevented, will stunt their growth and weaken their resistance to infections, resulting in needless human deaths due to high infant and child mortality rates.

In order to achieve a nutritionally improved city with inhabitants who are well-nourished, healthy, intelligent, socially, economically, and politically productive, the City of Manila must adopt and implement the provision of R.A. 11037 (Masustansyang Pagkain para sa Batang Pilipino), which is necessary to intensify the City’s campaign against malnutrition.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:
SECTION 1. Title. - This Ordinance shall be known as the “Masustansyang Pagkain para sa Batang Pilipino Ordinance”.

EXPLANATORY NOTE
The month of June every year serves as the most auspicious time to celebrate our identity as proud citizens of this country, in connection with the celebration of ""Araw ng Kalayaan"" on June 12 and the founding anniversary of the City of Manila, more known as ""Araw ng Maynila"" on June 24. Such celebrations remind us of our proud history as law-abiding citizens in one of the oldest cities in the country.

 The significance of Independence Day and Manila's Foundation Day lies in the struggles and sacrifices of strong Filipinos and martyrs who fought for the country's freedom and independence of this proud country
.
Such heroes and ancestors demonstrated the ability to focus on shared goals, push forward despite hardships, stay motivated, and act with determination.

Today’s fast-paced, social media-driven lifestyles of Millennials (born 1981–1996) and Generation Z (born 1997–2012) have somewhat dulled the sense of compassion for fellow countrymen, love for country, and the value of hard work, sacrifice, and, above all else, self-discipline.
Self-discipline is vital in every sector of society. It is reflected in: (a) Obeying traffic rules, (b) Paying correct taxes, (c) Taking care of the environment and natural resources, (d) Promoting a healthy lifestyle, and (e) Studying diligently.

This Ordinance seeks to remind Manileños of the importance of observing self-discipline to collectively uplift the quality of life in the city and ensure the sacrifices of past generations are not forgotten.

In view of the foregoing, the passage of this Ordinance is earnestly sought.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:
SECTION 1. Balik Disiplina sa Sarili Month. —  The month of June every year is hereby declared as ""BALIK DISIPLINA SA SARILI MONTH"" in the City of Manila.

SECTION 2. Observance. — The City Government of Manila, in coordination with concerned local government agencies, offices, and departments, shall plan and conduct appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities in observance of Balik Disiplina sa Sarili Month.
The program shall include:
•        (a) Regular weekly clean-up drives in each respective barangay;
•        (b) Random inspection of public utility vehicles (PUVs);
•        (c) Enforcement of city ordinances on basic health and hygiene;
•        (d) School values education seminars;
•        (e) Nutritional feeding programs;
•        (f) Physical fitness and healthy lifestyle programs;
•        (g) Proper pedestrian and PUV passenger etiquette;
•        (h) Other similar activities that are inclusive for women, children, youth, senior citizens, PWDs, heads of families, workers, and entrepreneurs.

SECTION 3. Separability Clause. —  If any provision, section, or part of this Ordinance is suspended, revoked, or declared null and void by a competent authority or the Supreme Court, all other provisions, sections, or parts not affected shall continue to be in full force and effect.

AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING A WOMEN AND CHILDREN CRISIS CENTER FOR THE VICTIMS/SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE AND ABUSE IN THE CITY OF MANILA, ADOPTING A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES

EXPLANATORY NOTE

Cases of violence against women and children in the country are increasing every year. Based on the data from the Philippine National Police (PNP), a total of 6,383 violence against women cases were reported to the PNP Women and Children Protection Center, while 9,677 cases of violence against children were tallied in the past seven months of 2022.

In Manila, 585 Anti-Violence Against Women and Children (VAWC) cases were recorded in the years 2020 and 2021 by the Manila Police District (MPD).

All forms of gender-based abuse and violence must be eradicated since they are inconsistent with people's inherent worth and dignity. Gender-based violence is a symptom of sexism that perpetuates human rights abuses, including putting people's lives and health in jeopardy. Women, children, and other genders who are victims of gender-based violence require specific protection and care, including adequate medical, psychological, and legal safeguards against all forms of abuse.

Section 40 of Republic Act No. 9262, or otherwise known as the Anti-Violence Against Women and Children (VAWC) Act, states the government must provide temporary shelters, counseling, psycho-social services and/or recovery, rehabilitation programs, and livelihood assistance.

Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7610, or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act, mandates the rehabilitation of children gravely threatened or endangered by circumstances which affect or will affect their survival and normal development, and over which they have no control. Section 3 of Republic Act No. 8505, or the Rape Victim Assistance and Protection Act, commands the establishment in every province and city of a Rape Crisis Center located in a government hospital, health clinic, or any suitable place that will provide psychological counseling, medical and health services with medico-legal examination, free legal assistance, privacy and safety for victims, and other related laws.

Section 2 of Republic Act No. 8353, or the Anti-Rape Law of 1997, cites the possibility of Human Immuno-Deficiency Virus (HIV)/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or any other sexually transmissible diseases and viruses being transmitted to the victim, and the need for a medical examination to be carried out in a private examination room.

Section 30 of Republic Act No. 9710, otherwise known as the Magna Carta of Women: Women in Especially Difficult Circumstances – For purposes of this Act, ""Women in Especially Difficult Circumstances"" (WEDC) shall refer to victims and survivors of sexual and physical abuse, illegal recruitment, prostitution, trafficking, armed conflict, women in detention, victims and survivors of rape and incest, and such other related circumstances which have incapacitated them functionally. Local government units are therefore mandated to deliver the necessary services and interventions to WEDC under their respective jurisdictions.

Section 31 of Republic Act No. 9710, or the Magna Carta of Women: Services and Interventions – WEDC shall be provided with services and interventions as necessary, such as, but not limited to, the following:

(a) Temporary and protective custody;
(b) Medical and dental services;
(c) Psychological evaluation;
(d) Counseling;
(e) Psychiatric evaluation;
(f) Legal services; and
(g) Productivity skills capability building.


Section 9.7 of City Ordinance 8681 or the Manila Gender and Development Code – Creation of Women and Children Crisis Center, the City Government shall create Women and Children Crisis Centers in the key districts of Manila under the supervision of the Manila Department of Social Welfare. This center will provide services to gender-based violence victims, prostituted women, and other genders victim of abuse. A 24-hr hotline for VAWC victims will be created that will be working closely with the Manila Police District Women’s Desk. This will also serve as a temporary shelter for the VAWG victims in their respective districts.

It is in this view that the immediate passage of this draft ordinance is earnestly sought.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. Title. – This Ordinance shall be known as the “Women and Children Crisis Center for Victims and Survivors of Violence and Abuse in the City of Manila.”

These services must include counseling, medico-legal, legal, psychological, and after-care supports such as livelihood assistance, and they must take a holistic and all-encompassing family approach to case management.

Through community/school advocacy and networking, the Local Government must also lessen and prevent the occurrence of violence against women, children, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people, and queers. The Local Government shall adopt and pursue an integrated system of policy direction, implementation, and enforcement of anti-gender-based violence policies, programs, and activities in order to achieve this purpose.

AN ORDINANCE AMENDING ORDINANCE NO. 8119, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS
THE “MANILA COMPREHENSIVE LAND USE PLAN AND ZONING ORDINANCE OF
2006”, TO INCLUDE MANILA SOLAR CITY PROJECT

EXPLANATORY NOTE

Manila Solar City (the “Project”) is a 148-hectare high-value and high-density
development that will rise in Manila Bay within the territorial waters of the City of Manila.

Presented before the City Council are Manila Goldcoast Development
Corporation’s (MGDC) Master Development Plan and Zoning and Land Use Plan.

Based on MGDC’s Master Development Plan and Zoning and Land Use Plan, the
Project features a modern urban setting while still recognizing Manila’s glorious heritage and rich culture. It will be comprised of three (3) islands, which will be interconnected by land bridges. Easements will be provided along the perimeter of the islands as buffer zones. Generous open and green spaces are incorporated to promote a natural environment within the city.

The Project area based on the attached Final Land Configuration approved and
issued by the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA) shall be: 6.92 hectares for the first island; 69.6 hectares for the second island; and 71.9 hectares for the third island.

The Final Technical Description shall be defined once the final land masses have
been constructed.

There will be a 120-meter-wide channel between each island to provide navigation
for sea vessels and an efficient flushing system; thereby ensuring and maintaining the good quality of water surrounding the whole development.

The average elevation of the Project will be at +4.00 meters above mean lower
low water or MLLW. Pre-engineering studies and activities were conducted to assess possible various impacts and geotechnical risks involved in the Project. Based on these studies, the Project is properly designed and engineered to ensure stability and safety.

The total volume of sandfill materials required is around Twenty-Four Million
(24,000,000) cubic meters, which shall be sourced from the approved seabed quarry area
of PRA. A sand key and containment bund surrounding the perimeter of the islands will
be provided for soil improvement. It will be compacted in order to prevent liquefaction
during utilizing rocks and boulders.

The Project will have a maximum Gross Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 12.

Each island shall be provided with a central utility area, i.e., each island has its
own power and water supply, as well as telecommunications facilities.

The Project will connect to the proposed Quirino-Macapagal Causeway/Viaduct. Its
proximity to the mainland makes it advantageous to directly connect to the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP), providing ease of accessibility. Future connections to existing city light rail systems and electronic monorail/people mover are envisioned. It will also be accessible by ferry and water taxis.

City Ordinance No. 8119 adopts the Comprehensive Land Use Plan/Zoning Ordinance of the City of Manila.

The City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) evaluated the completeness of all the documentary requirements submitted by MGDC and certified that said is in compliance with standards prescribed by applicable laws and rules.

On October 25, 2022, the CPDO rendered a report recommending the approval of the application for Master Development Plan and Zoning and Land Use Plan of MGDC for Manila Solar City.

This Body approves the application pursuant to Section 458, Paragraph 2(x) of Republic Act 7160, which states that the Sanggunian shall ""subject to national law, process and approve plans for residential, commercial, or industrial purposes and other development purposes, and to collect processing fees and other charges, the proceeds of which shall accrue entirely to the city xxxxx"".

CPDO and City Council approve the Master Development Plan and Zoning and Land Use Plan application of MGDC for Manila Solar City Reclamation Project consisting of approximately one hundred forty-eight square meters (148 sq. m.) along the Manila Bay coastline.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

AN ORDINANCE REVERTING THE GENERIC CAREER POSITION TITLES PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED IN ORDINANCE NO. 8653, ENACTED ON JULY 6, 2020, AS AMENDED BY ORDINANCE NO. 8712, ENACTED ON DECEMBER 7, 2020, TO LOCAL LEGISLATIVE POSITION TITLES FOR THE COTERMINOUS PRIMARILY CONFIDENTIAL EMPLOYEES OF THE SANGGUNIANG PANLUNGSOD NG MAYNILA

PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, sometime in 2018, the CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION FIELD OFFICE-MANILA (CSFO-MANILA) began invalidating the coterminous primarily confidential appointments in the legislative non-career service positions of the Manila City Council bearing position titles, namely: Local Legislative Staff Employee I, II, III, and V (LLSE I, II, III, and V) and Local Legislative Staff Officer I to VI (LLSO I to VI), due to the alleged non-compliance to the re-titling requirements under the provisions of CSC Memorandum Circular No. 12, Series of 2011 (Revised Guidelines on the Determination of Positions in the Local Government Units as Primarily Confidential);
WHEREAS, the Manila City Council has implemented remedial measures to resolve the alleged violation of CSC MC No. 12 s. 2011 through the passage of City Resolution No. 143, Series of 2018, re-titling the position titles of the invalidated appointments in its non-career legislative offices and adopting the position titles found in CSCMC No. 12, s. 2011 for non-career services positions therein classified as primarily confidential positions such as Executive Assistant, Private Secretaries, Security Agents, Security Officers and Personal Driver/Chauffeur;
WHEREAS, notwithstanding the passage of re-titling City Resolution No. 143, Series of 2018, there remained other invalidated primarily confidential appointments in the personal and confidential staff of the elected members of the Manila City Council bearing the position titles of LLSO II to IV; LLSE I to III; and Administrative I as they were not included in the position titles that were re-titled under Resolution No. 143 for the reason that there were no corresponding salary grades provided for said positions in CSC MC No. 12, s. 2011;
WHEREAS, in order to comply with the requirements of CSC MC 12, s. 2011, the Manila City Council has enacted re-titling City Ordinance No. 8653, entitled: “An Ordinance Adopting Generic Career Position Titles for the Coterminous Employees Assigned to the Offices of the Presiding Officer and Other Members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, Subject for Qualification Standards except for CSC Eligibility, and Coterminous with the Term of Office with the Head of Unit/Office,” which, upon the advice and guidance of CSCFO-Manila, was adopted pursuant to Section 9 (d) (1) and (2), Rule IV of the 2017 Omnibus Rules on Appointments and Other Human Resource Actions (“2017 ORAOHRA”). The ordinance provides for the re-titling of position titles for the remaining invalidated appointments, this time, with the requisite corresponding salary grades;
WHEREAS, after a careful examination, the officers of the Manila City Council have realized that the CSCFO-Manila’s advice to adopt Section 9 (d) (1) and (2), Rule IV, 2017 ORAOHRA as basis in the appointments of the personal and confidential staff in the non-career offices of the members of the City Council, will change the status of the appointments from being originally non-career coterminous primarily confidential to non-career coterminous appointments, which are not primarily confidential in nature;
WHEREAS, if the said re-titling City Ordinance No. 8653 would not be amended by using Section 9, (d) (3), Rule IV, 2017 ORAOHRA as basis, all the elected members of the City Council would be held administratively liable for nepotism as most of their personal and confidential staffs are related to them by affinity or consanguinity;
WHEREAS, as a corrective measure, the Manila City Council enacted City Ordinance No. 8712, basing it this time pursuant to Section 9, (d) (3), Rule IV, 2017 ORAOHRA instead of Section 9 (d) (1) and (2), Rule IV, 2017 ORAOHRA, thereby amending City Ordinance No. 8653;
WHEREAS, a review of the general functions of the foregoing items contained in the position description forms readily shows that the positions are primarily confidential in nature pursuant to the express declaration of law under Section 9 in relation to Section 59 of the 1987 Civil Service Law, to wit:
“SEC. 9. Non-Career Service.
XXX
The Non-Career Service shall include:
(1) Elective officials and their personal or confidential staff:”
(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
“SEC. 59. Nepotism. — All appointments in the national, provincial, city and municipal governments or in any branch or instrumentality thereof, including government-owned or controlled corporations, made in favor of a relative of the appointing or recommending authority, or of the chief of the bureau or Office, or of the persons exercising immediate supervision over him, are hereby prohibited.
xxx
(2) The following are exempted from the operation of the rules on nepotism:
(a) persons employed in a confidential capacity, (b) teachers,
(c) physicians, and (d) members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines:
Provided, however, that in each particular instance full report of such appointment shall be made to the Commission.”
(Emphasis and underscoring supplied)
WHEREAS, being personal staffs of the Vice-Mayor, City Councilors, and standing committees of the City Council, the duties and responsibilities of the appointees therein imply not only confidence in the aptitude but primarily close intimacy with the elected officials, which ensures freedom from misgivings or betrayals of personal trust. The work involves constant exposure to sensitive policy matters and confidential deliberations that are not always open to the public, as unscrupulous persons may use them to harm the functions of the Sanggunian;
WHEREAS, the Vice-Mayor and City Councilors must have the highest confidence in their staffs and employees to ensure that their honest and legitimate sentiments are always and fully expressed in the interest of the city and general public. Not only do their tasks point to sensitive and confidential acts, they also include such other functions as the Councilors and the Vice-Mayor may direct and/or require, a clear indication of a closely intimate relationship. In such highly acquainted relation, great trust and confidence between the recommending and appointing authorities and the appointee is required;
WHEREAS, the subject items cannot belong to the career service classification, which will bestow upon them regular and permanent status, which will prejudice future councilors and vice-mayors, who will not have coterminous staff;
WHEREAS, the primarily confidential position titles given under CSC Memorandum Circular No. 12 s. 2011 are apparently limited. They pertain to items bearing nomenclatures belonging to the executive branch, but not to personnel performing legislative support work;
WHEREAS, the primarily confidential position titles given under CSC Memorandum Circular No. 12 s. 2011 have different Salary Grades from the items of the Sangguniang Panlungsod under consideration, which will require budgetary adjustments. Unfortunately, the City of Manila could not seek an increase in the appropriations for Salary of city personnel without violating the personal services limitations under the Local Government Code and DBM circulars: NOW, THEREFORE,

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT: 
SECTION 1. Declaration of Policy. — It is hereby declared the policy of the City Government of Manila to faithfully observe the overriding goal of improving the delivery of vital services in terms of quality, scope, speed, accountability and affordability.
The generic career position titles previously adopted in Ordinance No. 8653, as amended by Ordinance No. 8712 shall be reverted to Local Legislative Positions Titles for the coterminous primarily confidential employees of the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, effective July 1, 2022.
Moreover, the plantilla position titles of the coterminous primarily confidential staff of the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, shall now be treated as specified below:

12.        Administrative Aide I (Utility Worker) — 1 — Administrative Aide I — 1
*Item No. 8 in the Plantilla Position previously titled as Local Legislative Staff Employee III shall now be titled Local Legislative Staff Assistant I. The correction is a mere typographical error as manifested by the Majority Floor Leader during the session of the City Council on August 30, 2022.

SEC. 2. Qualifications, Powers and Duties and Responsibilities. — The qualifications, powers, duties and responsibilities of the herein enumerated positions shall be based on the provisions of the Local Government Code, Civil Service Commission (CSC) circulars including the Administrative Code of 1987, R.A. No. 6758, entitled: “AN ACT PRESCRIBING A REVISED COMPENSATION AND POSITION CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM IN THE GOVERNMENT AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES” and other relevant laws, rules and regulations.

SEC. 3. Appointments. — The employment and appointment for those who will be occupying the herein subject positions shall be within the prescribed guidelines set forth by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and other relevant agencies.

SEC. 5. Effectivity. — This Ordinance shall take effect retroactively on July 1, 2022.

This Ordinance was finally enacted by the City Council of Manila on July 21, 2022.
","This ordinance changes the job titles of certain Manila City Council employees back to their original legislative titles, reversing previous ordinances (Nos. 8653 and 8712) that gave them generic career position names. It emphasizes that these employees are primarily confidential staff—closely working with the Vice-Mayor and Councilors—and should not have permanent career titles, to avoid issues like nepotism and budget constraints. The ordinance ensures that these roles remain coterminous, meaning they end when the official they work for leaves office, and their functions involve trust, confidentiality, and legislative support.

AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING THE AUTOMATION OF TRANSACTIONS
THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THE DIGITIZATION OF TRANSACTIONAL
DOCUMENTS IN ALL DEPARTMENTS, OFFICES, BUREAUS AND AGENCIES
UNDER THE CITY GOVERNMENT OF MANILA

EXPLANATORY NOTE

RE: AN ORDINANCE ESTABLISHING THE AUTOMATION OF TRANSACTIONS
THROUGH THE INTERNET AND THE DIGITIZATION OF TRANSACTIONAL
DOCUMENTS IN ALL DEPARTMENTS, OFFICES, BUREAUS AND AGENCIES
UNDER THE CITY GOVERNMENT OF MANILA

The proposed measure has for its purpose the establishment of an alternative towards a more significant and effective approach towards the transaction of business with the City Government in terms of inter-office interactions as well as interactions of the City Government with its constituency and the public at large. 

For so long, it has been noted that the City Government remains largely engaged in conventional means to fulfill its vast number of duties and functions. Computerization has already dominated the way official and employees go about their business, but much remains to be addressed. One line of action that is viewed as most appropriate is the conversion of orthodox means to automation with the end view of dispensing with physical contact with individuals and the need to utilize documents in paper from, which is alternatively achievable through digitization.

As of the time of submission of this proposed measure, the entire planet remains locked with the pandemic caused by the spread of COVID-19 since it was discovered in the first quarter of 2020. The City of Manila continues to wage war with the viral contagion that has both afflicted lives and ruined businesses, which are attributable to normal human interaction and the lack extreme caution in the handling of documents that are at the disposal of the City Government.

Thus, it is hereby declared the policy to adopt technologies in order to reduce document management in physical paper form, dispense with the burden of processing and safekeeping of physical documents, mitigate the need for personal presence and interaction, address the objective of avoiding health risks due to direct or indirect physical contact, and consider other relevant duties and functions or otherwise enhance existing ones, thereby improving work productivity.

SEC. 4. Effectivity Clause.
This Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its approval.

This Ordinance was finally enacted by the City Council of Manila on November 26, 2020.


","This ordinance updates the previous rule (Ordinance No. 8667) about giving COVID-19 Hazard Pay to city government workers in Manila who physically went to work during the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ). Originally, each eligible employee received PhP 500 per workday. However, some qualified workers were accidentally left out, and adjustments were needed for employees—especially healthcare workers—who worked longer shifts (12 to 24 hours). This amended ordinance provides additional funding and allows proportional hazard pay based on actual hours worked. For example, those who worked 12-hour shifts will receive 1.5 times the daily rate. The city will use savings from its 2020 budget to pay the additional PhP 8.6 million needed for this. No one will be required to return any extra amount they previously received. This aims to ensure fair and complete compensation for the risks city employees took during the COVID-19 outbreak.",Amended (Ordinance No. 8667),N/A,"November 26, 2020",https://citycouncilofmanila.com.ph/city_ordinances/ordinance-no-8705-2/

AN ORDINANCE REGULATING THE USE AND SALE OF VAPORIZED AND
HEATED TOBACCO PRODUCTS (VHTPs) IN PUBLIC PLACES AND PUBLIC
CONVEYANCES, ADVERTISEMENTS AND PROMOTIONS, AND PROVIDING
PENALTIES THEREFORE

PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, the 1987 Constitution declares it the policy of the state to protect and promote the right to health consciousness among them;

WHEREAS, a wide range of vapor and heated tobacco products (VHTPs) also known as e-cigarettes, have been introduced in the Philippines and globally. They are handled products that generate a nicotine - containing aerosol without combustion;

WHEREAS, Congress enacted Senate Bill No. 2233 with differentiated excise tax roles in recognition of the clear distinction between VHTPs-consisting of vapor products and heated tobacco products - which release an aerosol that can be inhaled without burning;

WHEREAS, last July 25, 2019, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed into law a bill raising the excise tax on tobacco products to support the governments universal health care program. Republic Act No. 11346 will hike tobacco excise tax rates on cigarettes and impose new taxes on heated tobacco and vapor products;

WHEREAS, an emerging body of scientific evidence shows that while not risk-free, VHTPs are far less harmful due to the lack of combustion. Public Health in England stated that carcinogenic constituents of cigarette smoke that harm health are either absent in e-cigarette vapor or if present, they are mostly at levels much below five percent (5%) of smoking doses a reduced risk potential based on the reduced level of air pollution where VHTPs are used compared to conventional cigarettes;

WHEREAS, regulating VHTPs in the exact same way as cigarettes, however, would fail to acknowledge the fundamental difference between combustible and non- combustible products and their respective risk profiles. Groups such as Public Health England and the British Lung Foundation have underscored the importance of regulating VHTPs or e-cigarette products differently from cigarettes;

WHEREAS, the proliferation of illicit or non-compliant of VHTPs is a serious problem that could deprive the government of potential revenue form excise tax collections and has the effect of flooding the market with cheaper VHTPs, thereby making them more accessible to the public, especially the youth;

WHEREAS, these non-compliant VHTPs, if not eradicated may pose a threat to the health of consumers because of their substandard quality;

WHEREAS, in order to fully protect the health and welfare of the citizens of Manila and further safeguard the interests of all stakeholders, including smokers who have the right to choose less harmful alternatives to cigarettes, there is a need to pass an ordinance regulating the use of vapor and heated tobacco products in public places and conveyances, including its advertising and promotion, in line with the latest scientific studies on thus class of products: NOW, THEREFORE,

AN ORDINANCE ADOPTING THE MEASURE APPROVING THE UPDATED AND FINAL ZONING/LAND USE PLAN, LAND ALLOCATION PLAN AND THE FINAL MASTER DEVELOPMENT PLAN OF HORIZON MANILA RECLAMATION PROJECT 

PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, HORIZON MANILA is a 406-hectare high-value and high-density
development that will rise in Manila Bay within the territorial waters of the City of Manila. Its 3-island landform will be the platform interlinked with urban parks and waterways reminiscent of Manila’s past waterways and riverside development but with a modern and green touch;

WHEREAS, the Project Area shall be as defined and limited to the metes and bounds as stipulated in the attached technical description submitted to the City Government of Manila for approval;

WHEREAS, the first three (3) islands is about three and a half kilometers west of the Manila Yacht Club, followed by the next two islands. Two-sixty meter wide water channels separate the three islands to provide for additional waterfronts accessible to the
public and to flush out stagnant water around the entire development;

WHEREAS, HORIZON MANILA's ground surface will be at a minimum of four (4) meters above sea level. It will be higher than most of the coastal areas of the City of Manila. The perimeter of the islands will be protected by revetment or sea wall of rocks and boulders. This will protect the islands from strong waves and storm surges and ensure that they will not be eroded back to the sea;

WHEREAS, around ninety (90) million cubic meters of filling materials will be required to reclaim HORIZON MANILA. It will be sourced from sea bed quarries within Manila Bay. This is to prevent the entry of materials from inland quarries that might pollute the Bay. The use of inland sources is not encouraged because it will require thousands
of trucks that will further congest the traffic and damage the city roads. The filling materials will be selected and compacted to address the concerns on earthquake and liquefaction;

WHEREAS, HORIZON MANILA will be highly accessible to its residents and the general public. A dedicated iconic skyway from Quirino Avenue will provide fast and direct access to HORIZON MANILA. There will be bridge interconnections with the neighboring developments as mandated by the government. A city-wide monorail system is planned to interconnect with HORIZON MANILA’s own people mover system. It will enhance its
accessibility. Sufficient utility infrastructure will be provided to be responsive to the requirements of the development. Water, power and telecommunications will be assured in HORIZON MANILA. Green Technology will be employed where applicable and practical: NOW, THEREFORE,

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session duly assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. Short Title. — This Ordinance shall be known as “HORIZON MANILA RECLAMATION PROJECT” for brevity.

SEC. 2. Declaration of Policy. — It is the policy of the city to pursue developmental projects and towards this end the reclamation of a specific area based on the specifications submitted by the proponent JBROS Construction Corporation and within the limits and  specifications set forth by competent authorities is hereby authorized.

SEC. 3. Scope of Reclamation. — The Updated and Final Zoning/Land Use Plan, Land Allocation Plan and the Master Plan submitted by the proponent shall define the scope of the reclamation project.

SEC. 4. Effectivity Clause. — This Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its approval.
This Ordinance was finally enacted by the City Council of Manila on
October 26, 2020.","This ordinance approves the updated zoning, land use, and master development plans for the Horizon Manila reclamation project—a 406-hectare development composed of three artificial islands in Manila Bay. The project will feature parks, waterways, green technology, and modern infrastructure including a skyway, monorail, and utility systems. The city supports this large-scale project led by JBROS Construction Corporation as part of Manila’s urban development goals.",Valid,N/A,"October 26, 2022",https://citycouncilofmanila.com.ph/city_ordinances/ordinance-no-8694-2/

CONVEYANCES, ADVERTISEMENTS AND PROMOTIONS, AND PROVIDING
PENALTIES THEREFORE

PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, the 1987 Constitution declares it the policy of the state to protect and promote the right to health consciousness among them,    

WHEREAS, a wide range of vapor and heated tobacco products (VHTPs) also known as e-cigarettes, have been introduced in the Philippines and globally. They are handled products that generate a nicotine - containing aerosol without combustion;   

WHEREAS, Congress enacted Senate Bill No. 2233 with differentiated excise tax roles in recognition of the clear distinction between VHTPs - consisting of vapor products and heated tobacco products - which release an aerosol that can be inhaled without burning;   

WHEREAS, last July 25, 2019, President Rodrigo Roa Duterte signed into law a bill raising the excise tax on tobacco products to support the governments universal health care program. Republic Act No. 11346 will hike tobacco excise tax rates on cigarettes and impose new taxes on heated tobacco and vapor products;   

WHEREAS, an emerging body of scientific evidence shows that while not risk-free, VHTPs are far less harmful due to the lack of combustion. Public Health in England stated that carcinogenic constituents of cigarette smoke that harm health are either absent in e-cigarette vapor or if present, they are mostly at levels much below five percent (5%) of smoking doses a reduced risk potential based on the reduced level of air pollution where VHTPs are used compared to conventional cigarettes;   

WHEREAS, regulating VHTPs in the exact same way as cigarettes, however, would fail to acknowledge the fundamental difference between combustible and non- combustible products and their respective risk profiles. Groups such as Public Health England and the British Lung Foundation have underscored the importance of regulating VHTPs or e-cigarette products differently from cigarettes;   

WHEREAS, the proliferation of illicit or non-compliant of VHTPs is a serious problem that could deprive the government of potential revenue form excise tax collections and has the effect of flooding the market with cheaper VHTPs, thereby making them more accessible to the public, especially the youth;   

WHEREAS, these non-compliant VHTPs, if not eradicated may pose a threat to the health of consumers because of their substandard quality;   

WHEREAS, in order to fully protect the health and welfare of the citizens of Manila and further safeguard the interests of all stakeholders, including smokers who have the right to choose less harmful alternatives to cigarettes, there is a need to pass an ordinance regulating the use of vapor and heated tobacco products in public places and conveyances, including its advertising and promotion, in line with the latest scientific studies on thus class of products: NOW, THEREFORE,   

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. Definitions of terms. - As used in this Ordinance:

AN ORDINANCE RETITLING THE POSITION TITLES IN THE ASSESSMENT RECORDS MANAGEMENT DIVISION AND ASSESSMENT STANDARDS AND EXAMINATION DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ASSESSMENT IN
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 5, CHAPTER 1 OF THE MANUAL ON REAL PROPERTY APPRAISAL AND ASSESSMENT OPERATIONS OF THE BUREAU OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE, DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PRESCRIBING THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND STAFFING PATTERN FOR PROVINCIAL/CITY/MUNICIPAL ASSESSOR'S OFFICE IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT UNITS

EXPLANATORY NOTE

As per Memorandum Circular No. 20, Series of 2012, of the Civil Service Commission, the existing qualification standards of assessors and appraiser positions was amended. In the local level, only the City Assessor III and Assistant City Assessor III was required to have an eligibility under R.A. 1080 (Real Estate Services). On the other hand, all positions for Local Assessment Operations Officer I to Local Assessment Operations Officer V in the national level is required to have the same eligibility. Since the City of Manila is a special city and the salary grade of positions is at par with the national level, the Civil Service Commission, through the City Personnel Office is also requiring the same eligibility in the City of Manila for all positions from Local Assessment Operations Officer I to Local Assessment Operations Officer V.

Under the approved Personnel Schedule of the Department of Assessment as incorporated in the Executive Budget of the City of Manila for the current and incoming year, all positions in the Assessment Records Management Division and Assessment Standards and Examination Division were reclassified as Local Assessment Operations Officer I, II, III, IV and V, despite the fact that they are not doing appraisal and assessment function but merely recording of transactions and safekeeping of records. As a consequence thereof, all personnel holding these positions are being deprived of any promotion since they are required to have this eligibility similar to their counterparts in the national level unless they take up a refresher course on Bachelor of Science in Real Estate Management (BSREM) for two (2) years and pass the board exam.

Henceforth, there is a need to retitle the positions in the Assessment Records Management Division and in the Assessment Standards and Examination Division of the Department of Assessment to conform with the position titles as provided for under Section 5, Chapter I, of the Manual on Real Property Appraisal and Assessment Operations (MRPAAO) prescribing the minimum and maximum organizational structure and staffing pattern for Provincial/City/Municipal Assessor's Office in the Local Government Units, thus giving the chance to holders of these position titles to be promoted after having served the city for more than two (2) decades, some of which are about to retire soon.

In view of the foregoing circumstances, approval of this Ordinance is hereby sought.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. Pursuant to Section 2, Chapter I, of the Manual on Real Property Appraisal and Assessment Operations, the BLGF shall exercise technical supervision and coordination over the treasury and assessment operations of local governments; provide consultative service and technical assistance on real property assessments, local taxation and other related matters; and exercise line supervision over its Regional Offices and the Local Treasury and Assessment Services nationwide.

SEC. 2. Prescribed likewise under Section 5, Chapter I, of the said Manual is the minimum and maximum organizational structure and staffing pattern for the Provincial/City/Municipal Assessor's Offices in the local government with the following divisions:

A. Assessment Operations Evaluation Unit
B. Administrative Division

C. Assessment Records Management Division
Assessment Records Officer V, SG-24
Assessment Records Officer IV, SG-22
Assessment Records Officer III, SG-18
Assessment Records Officer II, SG-15
Assessment Records Officer I, SG-11

D. Tax Mapping Operations Division
E. Property Appraisal Division

F. Assessment Standards and Examination Division
Assessment Examiner V, SG-24
Assessment Examiner IV, SG-22
Assessment Examiner III, SG-18
Assessment Examiner II, SG-15
Assessment Examiner I, SG-11

SEC. 3. Memorandum Circular No. 20, Series of 2012, amended the qualification standards of assessor and appraiser positions in the government and shall be filled only by registered and licensed practitioners, thus possess the required eligibility under R.A. 1080 (Real Estate Service). However, in the City of Manila, the Civil Service Commission through the City Personnel Office extended this eligibility requirements to all positions for Local Assessment Operations Officer I to Local Assessment Operations Officer V.

SEC. 4. Under the said Memorandum Circular No. 20, all position titles of Local Assessment Operations Officer I to Local Assessment Operations Officer V in the national level is also being required the same eligibility under R.A. 1080 (RESA). However, this is being applied to similar positions in the City of Manila being a special class city where the salary grade is at par with the national government, though excluded under the said circular.

SEC. 5. Under the approved Personnel Schedule of the Department of Assessment, as incorporated in the Executive Budget of the City of Manila for the current year, there are positions in the two (2) divisions of the department, namely the Assessment Records Management Division and the Assessment Standards and Examination Division, which were reclassified before as Local Assessment Operations Officer I to Local Assessment Operations Officer V despite the fact that they are not doing appraisal and assessment work but merely recording of transactions and safekeeping of records. Since these position titles are requiring the eligibility under R.A. 1080 (RESA), the holders of these positions are being deprived of any promotion unless they take up a two (2) year course of Bachelor of Science in Real Estate Management (BSREM) after which they have yet to pass the required board exam.

SEC. 6. The following position titles in the Assessment Records Management Division and Assessment Standards and Examination Division are hereby amended to conform with Section 5, Chapter I, of the Manual on Real Property Appraisal and Assessment Operations and to give the holders of these position titles to be promoted after having served the City of Manila for a number of years considering that they are not performing appraisal and assessment function:

A perusal of the ordinance under review shows no indication that the same had been voted upon by at least a majority of all members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod or the City Council of Manila.

Furthermore, it must be pointed out that the activity sought to be benefitted by the grant of exemption under the ordinance had already been allowed to proceed and concluded even before the ordinance had taken effect. Section 2 of Ordinance No. 8590 expressly provides that, ""[t]his Ordinance shall take effect upon its approval,"" which we took to mean the approval of the Honorable City Mayor. The activity sought to be benefitted had already been accomplished even before the ordinance took effect. Neither does the ordinance provide any indication of any future application since it was meant to apply specifically to the already concluded30th SEA Games to be held of 25 November 2019 to 10 December 2019. In other words, the approval of the ordinance under review no longer possesses any legal significance.

In view of the foregoing observations, this office recommends that City Ordinance No. 8590 be returned to the Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council) for the City of Manila for purposes of clarifying the above-mentioned matters.

","This ordinance grants tax and permit fee exemptions for venues used during the 30th Southeast Asian Games held from November 25 to December 10, 2019, specifically at the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex and the Manila Hotel Tents. However, the ordinance faced legal issues: it was only forwarded to the Mayor's Office in June 2022—nearly three years after the event—rendering it moot. The City Legal Office recommended its return to the City Council for clarification due to the delay and lack of immediate effectivity.",Valid,N/A,"November 18, 2019",https://citycouncilofmanila.com.ph/city_ordinances/ordinance-no-8590-2/

WHEREAS, the current space in custodial facilities maintained by the Manila Police Department (MPD) is inadequate to accommodate the influx of detainees, leading to overcrowding, with individual cells holding up to twice or even three times their capacity, forcing detainees to sleep piled together. At police stations, detainees are crammed into small spaces for long periods, awaiting trial;

WHEREAS, the overcrowding of detention facilities is compounded by the fact that since April 2018, the Manila Prosecutor's Office no longer holds night inquest duties beyond 5:00 PM.

WHEREAS, the inhumane conditions of custodial facilities have led to deaths and the spread of infectious diseases due to poor health and sanitation in congested detention facilities;

AN ORDINANCE REPEALING THE SECOND PERIOD INCREASE OF REAL PROPERTY TAX SCHEDULED TO TAKE EFFECT IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, AS STATED UNDER SECTION 3(d) OF ORDINANCE NO. 8330, ENTITLED: “THE 2014 GENERAL REVISION OF REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENTS AS AMENDED BY ORDINANCE NO. 8375”

PREAMBLE

WHEREAS, City Ordinance No. 8330 was passed into law on December 3, 2013, and took effect on January 1, 2014;

WHEREAS, the passage of City Ordinance No. 8330 was done as per the order of the Department of Finance through the Bureau of Local Government and the Commission on Audit;

WHEREAS, Section 3(d) of Ordinance No. 8330 was amended by Ordinance No. 8375 on December 4, 2014, to wit:

“SEC. 3. The Department of Assessment shall adopt the newly approved schedules specified in Section 1 hereof: PROVIDED, that:

d. The amount of tax to be paid by virtue hereof shall in no case be lower than the tax imposed thereon in 2013. Any tax increase, as a consequence of this Ordinance, shall be staggered into two (2) periods of payments at the rate of 60% for the first period (2014 to 2016) and 40% for the second period (2017), provided that the said rates are based on the incremental values of real properties. However:

i. For the first payment period (2014 to 2016), the total amount of tax to be paid on land, buildings, and other structures and machineries used for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes shall in no case be more than double the tax imposed for 2013 on the same real property;

ii. For the second payment period (2017) and succeeding years, the total amount of tax to be paid shall not exceed 150% of the tax imposed for 2013;

iii. It is understood, therefore, that the herein staggered relief pursuant to Section 192 of R.A. 7169 shall be applied only for a period of two (2) payment periods from the effectivity hereof.”

WHEREAS, in the implementation of said ordinance, the Real Property Tax collection considerably increased, resulting in additional revenues for the city, which boosted the funds in the City’s Coffers and Treasury;

WHEREAS, in the implementation of the first period increase in real property tax (60%), the considerable increase in tax collection enabled the City Government of Manila to pay and settle its debt obligations. The previous debt servicing payments made by the city throughout the years have been eradicated;

WHEREAS, the implementation of said increase had consequential results for the people. It is a fact that additional taxes place an additional burden on the paying public. As the saying goes, “Too much of the taxes may kill the horse that delivers the hay.” Thus, with the year 2017 fast approaching, the start of the second period stated in City Ordinance No. 8375 would be implemented soon unless legislative action is taken. Another tax increase, the 40% increase stated in City Ordinance No. 8330, would burden the public;

WHEREAS, there is a need to reconsider the impending implementation of the second period increase (40%) in Real Property Tax in 2017. NOW, THEREFORE,

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1. It is a principle of law that taxes are each and everyone's obligation to the government. It is every individual’s participation in sustaining and maintaining our government’s costs. Tax is the lifeblood of our government. Without it, there can be no funding for the public services our government provides. It is an inherent power of the government to create its own sources of revenue by law.

The power of taxation by our government is exercised not as an exercise of police power, but rather as a necessary means to settle the City Government's debts and obligations, which must be addressed to maintain public services.

As the increase stated in City Ordinance No. 8330 was divided into two periods (60% and 40%), with the first period implemented in January 2014, the propriety and necessity of implementing the second period (40% increase) are hereby re-evaluated.

As stated in the preceding paragraphs, the implementation of the first period increase led to a significant boost in the city’s funds, which allowed the City Government to settle its debts and remove most of its debt servicing obligations.

Maintaining the current tax rate without implementing the second period increase in 2017 would not be detrimental to the City Government of Manila. Since there is no more debt servicing to be accounted for, the City Government can now allocate its funds for further improvements to projects and programs without imposing additional burden on the public.

Thus, the portion of City Ordinance No. 8330, as amended by City Ordinance No. 8375, that provides for a second period increase of 40% in the real property tax rates is hereby REPEALED. Section 3(d) of said ordinance is hereby amended to read as follows:

“SEC. 3:

d. The amount of tax to be paid by virtue hereof shall in no case be lower than the tax imposed thereon in 2013. Any tax increase, as a consequence of this Ordinance, shall be at the rate of 60%, provided that the said rates are based on the incremental values of real properties. However:

i. The total amount of tax to be paid on land, buildings, and other structures and machineries used for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes shall in no case be more than double the tax imposed for 2013 on the same real property.”

SEC. 2. Effectivity Clause – This Ordinance shall take effect immediately upon its approval.

This Ordinance was finally enacted by the City Council of Manila on January 10, 2017.

","This ordinance cancels the second period (40%) increase in real property taxes that was supposed to take effect in 2017, as part of the city's plan to gradually increase taxes over two periods. The first increase (60%) was implemented in 2014 and helped the city pay off its debts. Since the city has already settled most of its debts, this ordinance removes the planned 40% tax increase, keeping taxes at the 60% increase rate, which won’t exceed double the tax rate from 2013.",Repealed (Repealed the 40% second period increase from Ordinance No. 8330),N/A,"January 10, 2017",https://citycouncilofmanila.com.ph/city_ordinances/ordinance-no-8516-2/

The amendments clarify the executive role in implementation while retaining the legislative powers of the City Council for future zoning revisions.

Key Changes Introduced:
Authority Shift:

The City Mayor now has the power to approve variances, exceptions, and zoning deviations, based on MZBAA's recommendation, rather than the City Council.

Affected Sections of Ordinance No. 8119:

Sections 11, 60, 61 (3 & 5), 62, 63, 73, 78(A), and 79 were amended.

Updated MZBAA Role:

MZBAA is to evaluate reports from the City Planning and Development Office (CPDO) and recommend action to the Mayor.

MZBAA handles appeals involving variances, exceptions, non-conforming uses, and complaints.

Zoning Permit (Locational Clearance):

Conforming uses: Clearance still issued by CPDO.

Non-conforming/variance-based uses: Require approval by the City Mayor via MZBAA recommendation.

Finality of Decision:

Decisions of the City Mayor on zoning appeals are final and executory.",Amended (Ordinance No. 8119),N/A,"October 18, 2016",https://citycouncilofmanila.com.ph/city_ordinances/ordinance-no-8502-2/

EXPLANATORY NOTE
The rights to own land and to build a home are both constitutional and natural rights.

Proceeding from this principle, it has been the consistent policy of the City Government of Manila to provide housing for its residents.

This policy applies equally to all who desire to reside in the city, regardless of the length of their stay. It is applied with greater liberality to those who have lived in the city for several decades but, for reasons beyond their control, have been unable to acquire their own home.

In this case, around one hundred families have been occupying a parcel of land measuring 1,231.22 square meters, located at Corcuera and Baltazar Streets, Barangay 88, Zone 7, District I, Tondo, Manila. For several decades, they have been paying the tax declaration on the land and have expressed sincere interest in purchasing it from the owner, Generosa Queenie M. Sengco.

It is timely and appropriate for the City Government to intervene on behalf of the residents, so that socialized housing may be established and offered at cost to bona fide residents under the Land-for-the-Landless Program of the City of Manila.

Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

Said property is registered under the name of Generosa Queenie M. Sengco, married to Ronald A. Sengco, in the Registry of Deeds for the City of Manila under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 292110, for the benefit of the actual and bona fide residents thereat, under the Land-for-the-Landless Program of the City of Manila.

SEC. 2.
The City Mayor is hereby authorized to utilize any available funds in the City Treasury or access funding facilities from other government agencies for this purpose.

SEC. 3.
The aforementioned parcel of land, once acquired, shall be for the benefit of the bona fide tenants and occupants, particularly the registered members of the Corbal Brotherhood Association (CBA).

SEC. 4.

For each standard menu item offered for sale, covered establishments shall, in a clear and conspicuous manner, make a corresponding nutrient content disclosure as follows:

—was passed by the City Council of Manila on June 12, 2007. This ordinance essentially authorized the City Mayor to acquire the specified parcel of land for distribution under the City’s Land-for-the-Landless Program.

The officers and members of Huwag Kang Bibitiw, Inc., a duly registered organization with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the intended beneficiaries of the program, worked diligently for the passage of the above measure.

However, it was later discovered that the final wording of the ordinance inadvertently excluded the group from being explicitly mentioned, despite being intended beneficiaries. Upon review of the minutes of the relevant City Council sessions, it was determined that no such exclusion was ever officially made during deliberations. The discrepancy appears to be a result of simple inadvertence.

AN ORDINANCE DECLARING THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF BARANGAY 630, ZONE 63, DISTRICT VI, MANILA, TO SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE THE AREA OF PNR RAILROAD TO THE NORTH, POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES COMPOUND TO THE SOUTH, PASIG RIVER TO THE EAST, AND PNR STA. MESA STATION TO THE WEST, WHICH INCLUDES THE EL PUEBLO AND MAUI OASIS CONDOMINIUMS (FORMERLY PHILIPPINE NATIONAL OIL COMPANY), THUS AFFIRMING CITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION NO. 67, SERIES OF 2014, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES

PREAMBLE
WHEREAS, Barangay 630, Zone 63, District VI, City of Manila, requested that their Barangay Resolution be approved by the City College of Manila, thereby allowing the release of their accumulated lawful share of Real Property Taxes from previous years, derived from commercial and industrial establishments within their territorial jurisdiction;

WHEREAS, in support of their claim, the barangay presented a resolution from the Liga ng mga Barangay authorizing the release and use of the said funds, along with their own Barangay Resolution, cadastral map, and copies of business permits and clearances issued to various establishments within the claimed area;

WHEREAS, there were no similar claims from other adjoining barangays, and Barangay 630 was able to provide clear and convincing evidence of their territorial jurisdiction, leading to the passage of City Council Resolution No. 67, Series of 2014, on March 6, 2014, affirming their request;

WHEREAS, months later, certain officials from neighboring barangays filed their opposition with the Office of the Mayor, prompting a committee hearing where all concerned barangays were notified and given the opportunity to present their position and submit supporting documents;

WHEREAS, during the hearing, the committee took note of the Audit Observation Memorandum (AOM) dated June 30, 2014, issued by the Commission on Audit (COA), which stated that:

""Notwithstanding the above resolutions, we noted the absence of a City Council Ordinance that would support the legal basis for the release of funds to Barangay 128 and Barangay 853 as required by Section 6 of the Local Government Code...""

WHEREAS, Section 6 of the Local Government Code provides that the boundaries of a barangay may only be altered by ordinance passed by the Sangguniang Panlungsod;

COMMITTEE FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
The barangay-claimants are correct in asserting their right to receive their accumulated share of Real Property Taxes from commercial and industrial establishments located within their jurisdiction.

This matter does not involve the creation, division, merging, abolition, or substantial alteration of barangay boundaries as defined under Section 6 of the Local Government Code.

In consideration of the COA opinion and to settle the matter definitively, the Committee recommends the passing of an ordinance officially declaring the territorial jurisdiction of Barangay 630 and affirming the previous resolution.

The draft ordinance should be amended through substitution to align with the above findings.

NOW, THEREFORE,
Be it ordained by the City Council of Manila, in session assembled, THAT:

SECTION 1.
It is hereby declared that all commercial and industrial establishments within the area bounded by the PNR Railroad to the North, the Polytechnic University of the Philippines Compound to the South, the Pasig River to the East, and the PNR Sta. Mesa Station to the West—including the El Pueblo and Maui Oasis Condominiums (formerly Philippine National Oil Company)—are within the territorial jurisdiction of Barangay 630, Zone 63, District VI, Manila.

SECTION 2.
City Council Resolution No. 67, Series of 2014, is hereby affirmed.

SECTION 3. Transitory Provision.
All income, governmental, and corporate services pertaining to the area mentioned shall henceforth be collected, delivered, and performed by Barangay 630, Zone 63, District VI, Manila.

SECTION 4. Separability Clause.
If any provision of this Ordinance is declared unconstitutional or invalid, the remaining provisions shall continue to be in full force and effect.

SECTION 5. Effectivity Clause.
This Ordinance shall take effect upon its approval.

ENACTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL OF MANILA ON JANUARY 13, 2015.
